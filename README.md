## :movie_camera: :running: :running: Suspicious-Activity-Detection-Using-Pose-Estimation

## 📝 Description
- This implemantation is based on official **AlphaPose** Algorithm.
- It is **‘AlphaPose’** & **‘XGBOOST’** based **“Suspicious-Activity-Detection-Using-Pose Estimation”** project.
- Purpose of this project is to make a system which can detect if someone is trying to climb a house compound wall & trying to do some suspicious activity.
- This model will detect this activities accurately & helps to prevent those kind of activities by giving real time feedback.
